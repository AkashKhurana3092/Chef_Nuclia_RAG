### Control ID: 1.1.1
**Control Title:** Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more password(s)'

**Recommended State:** The value for this policy setting must be set to 24 or more passwords.

### Sample Chef Remediation Cookbook

```ruby
# Cookbook Name:: cis_benchmark_remediation
# Recipe:: enforce_password_history

# This recipe ensures that the 'Enforce password history' policy is set to 24 or more passwords.

# Define the registry key and value
registry_key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System' do
  values [{
    name: 'PasswordHistorySize',
    type: :dword,
    data: 24
  }]
  action :create
end

# Notify the user about the change
log 'Password history enforcement has been set to 24 or more passwords.' do
  level :info
